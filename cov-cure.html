      <h2>Treating COVID-19</h2>
      <p>
        Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home. You
        can treat

          >symptoms</a

        with over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to
        help feel better.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have COVID-19 and are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19,

        that can reduce your chances of being hospitalized or dying from the
        disease. Medications to treat COVID-19 must be prescribed by a
        healthcare provider or pharmacist and started within 5 to 7 days after
        symptoms appear. Contact a healthcare provider right away to determine
        if you are eligible for treatment, even if your symptoms are currently
        mild.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Don't delay: Treatment must be started within 5 to 7 days of when you
        first develop symptoms.

      <h3>Treatment</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Mild Cases:</b> Most people with COVID-19 will experience mild
          symptoms and can recover at home with rest, hydration, and symptomatic
          treatment, such as fever reducers.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Severe Cases:</b> Hospitalization may be necessary for those with
          severe symptoms. Treatment might include oxygen therapy, antiviral
          medications, and corticosteroids to reduce inflammation.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b> Monoclonal Antibodies and Antivirals:</b> For certain high-risk
          patients, treatments like monoclonal antibody therapy and antiviral
          drugs can help reduce the severity of the disease if administered
          early in the course of infection.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Supportive Care:</b> For those in critical condition, intensive
          care support, including mechanical ventilation, may be required.
        </li>

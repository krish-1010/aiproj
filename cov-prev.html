          <h2>Treating COVID-19</h2>
          <p>
            There are many ways your actions can help protect you, your
            household, and your community from severe illness from COVID-19.
            CDC's COVID-19 hospital admission levels provide information about
            the amount of severe illness in the community where you are located
            to help you decide when to take action to protect yourself and
            others.
          </p>

          <p>
            COVID-19 vaccines help your body develop protection from the virus
            that causes COVID-19. Although vaccinated people sometimes get
            infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, staying up to date on
            COVID-19 vaccines significantly lowers the risk of getting very
            sick, being hospitalized, or dying from COVID-19. CDC recommends
            that everyone stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines, especially
            people with weakened immune systems.

          <h4>Actions that can improve ventilation and filtration include:</h4>

          <div class="f">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Bringing in as much outdoor air as possibleâ€”for example, opening
                windows.
              </li>
              <li>
                Increasing air filtration in your heating, ventilation, and air
                conditioning (HVAC) system, such as by changing filters
                frequently and using filters that are properly fitted and
                provide higher filtration.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaners.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <h3>Preventive Measures</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Vaccination:</b> Receiving a COVID-19 vaccine is the most
              effective way to prevent the disease and reduce the severity of
              symptoms if you do get sick.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Mask Wearing:</b> In crowded or indoor settings, especially in
              areas with high transmission rates, wearing masks can help reduce
              the spread of the virus.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b> Hand Hygiene:</b> Regularly washing your hands with soap and
              water for at least 20 seconds or using hand sanitizer with at
              least 60% alcohol can kill the virus.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Physical Distancing:</b> Keeping a distance of at least 6 feet
              from others can reduce the risk of transmission.
            </li>
